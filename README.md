# kalmanrs 

This library directly implements the algorithm found [here](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~welch/media/pdf/kalman_intro.pdf). kalmanrs is build using nalgebra, and is designed to be as dimensionally generic as possible to make it easy to implement in whatever control structure or system you're working with. 

## Setup 


## Usage


## Todo
- Add usage examples (for all three filter types)
- Add support to master branch for the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).
- Add support to master branch for the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). 
- Better testing/test coverage
